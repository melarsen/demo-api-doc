            Some name of a spesific part of the system, like an id for an integration, app or API ?   
            At least for our own integrations we should be able to provide this, and API-partners should use this.

          example: '6300'
          description: | 
            TBD...   
            Internal customer id for the source system (Logistra or Proteria customerId).   
            This is the id in the source system of the customer requesting this booking
